You just heard Morgan talk about all the wide range of things that can be done on EC2 and compute at AWS. Some of you though, you just want to simplify the whole process. You don't want to be a developer. You don't want to go through the process of spinning up an EC2 instance. You just want a solution to running your application. Well, AWS has a solution called Lightsail, that has a number of pre-built options, you simply select, launch, and you're done. For example, you might just want a WordPress site. Lightsail has one already built for you. All you have to do is select it, and for a few dollars a month, all of the management is taken care of on AWS's side. So, whether it's a WordPress site or perhaps an e-commerce site, in which case you might use our magneto offering. We have offerings for Drupal and Joomla and Redmine and Plesk. Whole variety of different options. Or maybe you want a dev environment that your developers could work in, with a LAMP stack or a MEAN stack or maybe a Docker environment. Maybe you want your own GitLab, or just a programming environment, a Node.js or an Nginx server. The key part to Lightsail is AWS takes care of all the choices that now you don't have to make. Remember, the reason AWS exists is to help eliminate your undifferentiated heavy lifting. So, AWS automatically provides a secure network, SSD storage, any load balancing you need. We take care of all the backups and compute all these things that make up those pieces of your application, now we are just there for you, all you have to worry about is the content. You know what? Let's see how this plays out for real.
