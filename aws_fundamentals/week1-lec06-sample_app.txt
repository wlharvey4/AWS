Hi everyone, Morgan here. Throughout this course, we're going to be building out a corporate directory application to show everybody how different AWS services can work together to build an application. If we look here, you can see our standard architecture. We're going to have traffic coming in through the internet to hit an Elastic Load Balancer, or what we'll call an ELB. From there, the ELB will distribute traffic across our Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, instances. We also are going to be using Amazon Simple Storage Service, or S3, to store images for our application, and we'll be using two different types of databases behind the scenes, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon Relational Database Service, or RDS. Let's take a look at what our application is going to look like when everything's all said and done. Here's our application. You can see we already have data populated in the application. We have Blaine and Allen added as contacts in our corporate directory. So, let's go ahead and add another one. I'm going to add myself. So, I'm going to just click on the Add button here and give myself a name. My name is Morgan Willis, location is USA, and job title is Tech Trainer. I'm going to give myself some attributes like Mac User, Frequent Flier, and Paperclip Aficionado. I'll go ahead and save this. I realized I didn't give myself an image, but the lucky thing is that our application allows us to edit records as well. I'm going to select my entry, click Edit, and then I will choose an image, select my image, open it, and save. So, now, we've been redirected back to our home screen here and you can see we've added me into the application. We also have the ability to delete. So, this is what our application is going to look like when everything's all said and done. I've mentioned a few services like Elastic Load Balancing, EC2 instances, and S3. Don't worry too much about that for now. We're going to cover these in detail throughout the rest of the course.
