* Introduction to AWS

Welcome back, Blaine here. Today, we want to talk about an introduction to AWS,
to its services.

** What is Cloud • What is AWS

But to do that, I really want us to look at the question, what is cloud? What
is AWS? There's many definitions out there, but the one that we're going to go
with for this course is the idea of

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

an on-demand, pay-as-you-go, IT services that are delivered over the
internet.

#+END_QUOTE

Each one of those parts are important.

*** On-Demand Service

The idea of an on-demand service, that you don't have to make any advanced
contracts with us, you don't have to let us know what's needed. The moment you
need services like storage and compute or networking, they're available
immediately without any advanced contract,

*** Pay-As-You-Go

which goes the same as pay-as-you-go. That, you don't have to have any prepaid
tier, there's no minimum requirement needed to be part of AWS.

*** Delivered Over The Internet

Delivered over the internet, means it's secure and available anywhere for you
and your business.

*** Cloud

That's what cloud is.

** Why Is Cloud • Why Does AWS Exist

But a better question, ``why is cloud?  Why does AWS exist in the first
place?''  People might say, ``Well, it's just a substitute for what you have
on-premises.''  I disagree with that statement.

*** IT As a Series of Actions

Instead, a better answer to why AWS exists, is to look at the idea of IT as a
series of actions, and some of them are very important to your business, and
some of them are common everywhere. Everybody needs compute, everyone needs
storage, everyone needs identity management.

*** AWS Eliminates Undifferentiated Tasks

AWS exists to eliminate those undifferentiated heavy lifting tasks that your IT
department needs, that everyone's IT department needs. This means your business
can spend time working on what is strategically unique to you rather than
repetitive common tasks that everyone has to do.

** What is AWS Cloud

So, what are the things that make up the AWS Cloud? Well, there are some
obvious things we've already talked about.

*** Compute • Storage • Networking

This idea of compute. Common areas where you can do all your calculations,
storage of all different types, networking that allows you to have your own
private network, while at the same time allowing it exactly who you want to
have be part of your application.

**** Additional Services

But AWS, we go so far beyond that, and there's many other things that are not
so obvious at first blush.

***** Security

AWS has a high level of security with many security features written especially
for your operations team.

***** Automation

 We have automation suites designed to deploy all of your applications, all of
your databases, all of your environments automatically.

***** Database as a Service

We have database as a service.

***** DevOps

DevOps, which can be delivered soup to nuts right there as part of the services
that we offer.

***** Other

Media services, artificial intelligence, machine learning, ML,
Internet of Things, IoT, services like game development, identity management,
augmented reality, virtual reality, big data analytics, and the list keeps
going on.

*** 150 Services

We have over 150 unique services at AWS, and that list continues to grow year
after year. The pace of innovation AWS is one of the important factors we
bring, that we're constantly adding, constantly innovating on behalf of you,
our customers. We even have a partner network designed to answer questions that
may be specific to you and your vertical. The AWS Partner Network, APN, along
with the AWS Marketplace, can provide on-demand solutions, pay-by-the-hour
solutions, that will allow your company to get exactly what it needs, when it
needs it. All right. Next topic, let's look how AWS distributes our services
globally.
