Hi. I'm Blaine Sundrud, Senior Technical Trainer for AWS. I'm Morgan Willis, I'm a Senior Technical Trainer here with Amazon Web Services. I'm Allen Goldberg, I'm a Technical Program Manager at AWS. I've been in technology for about a decade now. I started off like a lot of other people did, just as helpdesk. I'm a teacher. I've always been a teacher. I had no choice but to be a teacher. My mama was a teacher, my daddy was a teacher, my grandpa was a bartender. I was doomed to be a teacher. I ended up in computer programming where I was a Java developer for a number of years, and then I started teaching Java development. My first job ever was as a swim instructor, and I got to teach people how to swim, and when they get it, there's a sense of accomplishment that the students get, and it's really a lot of fun. One of the things I really like about AWS, is the way that we focus not just on the features, or about the company. We are about the customer, and we want to know what prompts do the customer have, what do they need to solve. Something that I love about working for Amazon Web Services, is just that there's so much to learn, and our platform is so broad that really we can help a wide variety of customers. You see the lights go on, you see when someone didn't understand something, now they get it, now they say, oh how can I use this. We're here to help customers with their real-world problems, solving some amazing things. It's our customers that are what's really amazing out there, the technology, were just giving a platform. The thing about Amazon Web Services, is that because we have so many different types of features available on our platform, we can help a wide variety of customers. So, I get to help out all different types of people and push myself, and continue to learn over time as well.
