* Welcome
Welcome to the AWS Fundamental Series on Coursera. I'm Allen Goldberg,
Technical Program Manager in AWS Training and Certification. In this class,
Going Cloud Native, we will focus on some key technology areas and
services.

** Compute
   - Amazon Elastic Compute Cooud
   - Amazon Lightsail
   - Virtual Private Cloud networking technology

 Specifically, for compute, we will look at Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and
 Amazon Lightsail. We will discuss virtual private cloud and other networking
 technologies.

** Storage
   + Amazon S3
   + Elastic Block Storage
   + Elastic File Service
   + Amazon DynamoDB
   + Amazon Relational Database Service

 For storage. we'll see how to use Amazon S3, Elastic Block Storage, and
 Elastic File Service. We'll also explore Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Relational
 Database Service.

** Monitor and Scale
   + Amazon CloudWatch and Auto Scaling

 How do you monitor and scale your application environment?  We'll use Amazon
 CloudWatch and Auto Scaling.

** Secure

 Finally, we'll examine how you can secure your environment in AWS and manage
 cost.

** Cloud-based App
   + AWS Management Console

 We'll do all of this through a cloud-based application that we'll build over
 the course of the class. The app stores images and information about fictional
 employees in a company. There's no coding requirement for this course. All of
 the examples and demonstrations, we'll use the AWS Management Console.

** Instructors

 I will be joined in this class by two of my AWS Training and Certification
 colleagues, Blaine Sundrud and Morgan Willis.  In the next segment, we'll
 introduce ourselves and then move on to course content.

** Course Content
   + AWS Regions and Availability Zones
   + Compute Services
   + Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
   + Amazon Lightsail

 Blaine will begin with an overview of AWS, where he'll talk about AWS Regions
 and Availability Zones, and why they matter. Morgan will then walk you through
 our application, introduce you to compute services, and dive deeper into
 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2. Blaine will finish up the first module
 with a look at Amazon Lightsail, a service that allows you to quickly and
 easily spin up entire web-based application servers with just a few
 clicks. Along the way, there'll be quizzes and links to resources to help make
 sure you're on the right track. So, again, welcome to Going Cloud Native on
 AWS. As we say at Amazon, work hard, have fun, make history.
